<p>Just a few updates from the girls:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chloe: I continue to do really well. Mom keeps forcing 50cc feeds down me every 3 hours. It seems like a lot for my little frame and tummy, but they tell me it is what I need to make me grow. When I get really tired I get a tube down my nose which is actually much easier, because I can just sleep through that. &nbsp;I will probably be here for another week just figuring out this whole suck and swallow thing -- it's harder than you'd think when your only 5 1/2 pounds and meant to still be in mom's tummy. I am also getting damn near smothered by two babies worth of hugs and cuddles from my parents. I hope Emaline gets of her ventilator soon so she can help share this pent up affection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Emaline: I am doing okay. My PDA* is closed now which is good. Unfortunately my lungs are still not mature, and I have been on the ventilator longer than anyone anticipated. I never did like the thing, and I kick my legs and flail my arms to let everyone know it. Now mom is growing quite tired of it as well. &nbsp;She just really wants to pick me up and hold me, but she will have to be patient. When no one is around she leans over my bed and presses her cheek against my bare belly and I like that. Daddy leans over me and talks to me whenever he gets the chance. He loves me so much.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our parents are hanging in there, but we can tell they are already getting tired. Mom is surprisingly busy pumping milk for us and feeding just the one of us. She has no idea how she is going to do it when we both need her. &nbsp;Dad has been burning the pavement between Broken Bow and Kearney. He is somehow managing to take care of his hospital and ER patients, visit us every day, take care of our hyper dog and house, and occasionally fit in a shoulder rub for mom (she's got him convinced it will help with her milk let down). He hasn't had a chance to shave since we were born, and food is going rotten in our fridge at home, but he always manages to get here with a smile on his face and plenty of love to smother us with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We thank you all for all your well wishes and visits. We can't wait to come home and meet our dog and all our parents' friends who have promised to come hold us!</p>
<p>*many people have asked about the patent ductus areriosus mentioned by our super smart dad. He tells us that it is a normal shunt present in babies before they are born. It shunts oxygenated blood from the left side of the heart (aorta) to the right side (pulmonary artery). This allows oxygen to get the the lung tissue. Once were are born the lungs expand and pressure in them increases which normally forces the ductus closed. If the lungs aren't mature, however, the pressure never gets high enough and the ductus will remain patent. It's no big deal really, and it's all closed up now.</p>
