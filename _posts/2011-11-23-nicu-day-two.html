title: NICU Day Two
---

<p>Our Mom is doing great!  She visits us all the time and feeds Chloe on a very rigorous schedule. She really loves all her flowers.</p>

<p>Chloe is eating almost 20 mL at every feeding and may get to go up to 40 mL tomorrow. She is impressing all the nurses. </p>

<p>Emaline is still on the ventilator. Her echocardiogram showed a patent ductus arterioisus. She is receiving medicine to close it, but while on the medicine and the ventilator she can't be fed or held. This makes our parents kind of sad. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, Emaline has to be sedated while on the ventilator and she is now under special lights to lower her bilirubin. We would really like to be together like we were for the last 34 weeks but we will just have to be patient.</p>
