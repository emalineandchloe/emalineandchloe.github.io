<p>I am off the vent!! The doctors were dragging their feet a bit with me, so I just went ahead and pulled that pesky tube out myself. I am doing great on room air, and I graduated to an isolette. My parents still can't hold me until tomorrow but they are so stinking excited. Tomorrow I have been told that Chloe &amp; I can have baths so mom and dad are looking forward to that. We are sure some pics will be taken, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>Pic on top is Emaline and below that is Chloe. Btw, Chloe continues to be an allstar and may even be discharged in the next day or two.</p>
